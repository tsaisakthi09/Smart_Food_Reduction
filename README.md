Smart Food Reduction Web App
TechSprint 2026 | Build with Google, Build for Impact

Project Overview
This project is a platform designed to address food waste by connecting food donors such as hostels, canteens, and restaurants directly with NGOs and local communities in real-time.

Problem Statement
Institutional kitchens and event organizers often have significant amounts of high-quality surplus food that is discarded due to a lack of immediate coordination with distribution networks. This leads to environmental degradation and missed opportunities to alleviate hunger.

Donation Portal: Interface for donors to list food items, quantities, and pickup windows.

NGO Dashboard: A real-time feed for organizations to browse and claim available donations nearby.

AI Food Safety Advisor: Uses Google Gemini to analyze food types and storage times to provide safety guidelines for redistribution.

Secure Authentication: User-specific roles for donors and NGOs.

Impact Tracking: A centralized dashboard to monitor the total volume of food saved.

Google Technologies Used
Google AI Studio (Gemini API): Powering the intelligent food safety analysis and automated categorization.

Firebase: Utilized for real-time database management (Firestore) and secure User Authentication.

Google Cloud: Proposed for scalable hosting and backend processing via Cloud Run.
